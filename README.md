# adVAE: Alzheimer's Data Variational Autoencoder

### The proposed Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model framework aims to aid with high-quality Alzheimer's Disease (AD) data augmentation.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects memory, thinking and other cognitive abilities. Its increasing incidence among the older population necessitates a need for more comprehensive research to understand its underlying mechanisms and develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.


Deep learning models are becoming increasingly popular in the analysis of transciptomic, multi-omic and other biomedical data aiding in research. However, a key challenge in training such models is their requirement for large datasets. High-quality clinical data for Alzheimer's patients is scarce, and hence, data augmentation is needed to address the challenges posed by small sample sizes.


AD-VAE aims to tackle this challenge and aid Alzheimer's research by using Variational Autoencoders to synthesize artificial, high-quality multimodal data. 


**Input:** Biomedical data from AD individuals (gene expression, EEG, MRI).

**Output:** A latent space that is capable of generating more artificial, high-quality multimodal data for AD research.


**Programming language:** Python 3.9.18

**License:** OSI Approved - MIT License

**Environment:** Recommended to have Great Lakes HPC access for GPU usage
