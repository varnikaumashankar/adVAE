# AD-VAE

### The proposed Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model framework aims to aid with high-quality Alzheimer's Disease (AD) transcriptomic data augmentation.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects memory, thinking and other cognitive abilities. Its increasing incidence among the older population necessitates a need for more comprehensive research to understand its underlying mechanisms and develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.


Deep learning models are becoming increasingly popular in the analysis of transciptomic and other multi-omic data aiding in research. However, a key challenge in training such models is their requirement for large datasets. High-quality clinical data for Alzheimer's patients is scarce, and hence, data augmentation is needed to address the challenges posed by small sample sizes.


AD-VAE aims to tackle this challenge and aid Alzheimer's research by using Variational Autoencoders to synthesize artificial, high-quality transcriptomic data. 


**Input:** Gene expression profile for a number of genes from AD and non-AD individuals.

**Output:** A latent space that is capable of generating more artificial, high-quality transcriptomic data for AD patients.


**Programming language:** Python 3.12.2

**License:** OSI Approved - MIT License

**Environment:** Requires Great Lakes HPC access for GPU usage
