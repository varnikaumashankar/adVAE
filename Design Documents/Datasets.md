### Dataset Information:

This model will be trained primarily on gene expression data.

Input: Gene Expression profiles (transcriptomics data) from AD and non-AD samples

Possible additional functionality: Train the model using multimodal data (EEGs etc.). 
In such a case, additional inputs will be EEGs from AD and non-AD individuals.

Data format:
- 2D Matrix with genes and samples as rows and columns

Gene expression data can be obtained from (non-exhaustive): (search for AD specific data form following sources)
